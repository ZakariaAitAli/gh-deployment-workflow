# GitHub Pages Deployment

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **GitHub Actions** to implement **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)** for a static website hosted on **GitHub Pages**. The workflow ensures that changes made to the `index.html` file in the main branch are automatically deployed.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- A **GitHub repository** (e.g., `gh-deployment-workflow`).
- A simple `index.html` file containing: `"Hello, GitHub Actions!"`.
- A **GitHub Actions workflow** in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to handle deployment.
- The workflow should only trigger when `index.html` is modified.
- The website should be accessible at: `https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Stretch Goals
- Use a static site generator like **Hugo, Jekyll, or Astro** to create a more advanced site (e.g., a portfolio).

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts Learned
- **GitHub Actions**
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Writing GitHub Actions Workflows**
